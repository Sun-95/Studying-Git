<h2>2. Creating a project</h2>
<h3>1) Create a “Hello, World!” page</h3>
<p>I started with an empty directory and added an empty subdirectory called work and then created a hello.html file in it. [Screenshot 2.1](screenshots/2.1.png)</p>

<h3>2) Create a repository</h3>
<p>So there is a directory that contains one file. Ran git init to create a Git repository from this directory.[Screenshot 2.2](screenshots/2.2.png)</p>

<h3>3) Add the page to the repository</h3>
<p>Now let's add the “Hello, World” page to the repository. [Screenshot 2.3](screenshots/2.3.png)</p>
